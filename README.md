# Assessment with Cypress for Breeze Airways
## In order to download and launch tests Node installed is required 
### 1. Download / clone current repository
### 2. Use `npm install` within VSCode terminal
### 3. Use either `npx cypress open` in order to open Cypress browser or `npm run test` in order to run scripts within the terminal
### 4. After running the tests using `npm run test`, use `npm run report:open` to open the beautiful Allure report

Cypress tests are in `cypress/e2e/`

Reusable functions I've created are in `cypress/support/`


There are a couple of good functions in `cypress/support/utils/`
